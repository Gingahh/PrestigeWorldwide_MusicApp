Music sharing app for Android written in Android Studio (Java)

This is a group project made with:

You can make a music room and add Youtube songs to the queue. Other users can join the room and listen to the queue.

# How to Run
Clone the project and run it on an Android emulator. I use Android Studio's emulator for Nexus 5X. The emulator needs to have the Play Store.
